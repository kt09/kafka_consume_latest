# You can enter as many threads to stimulate a load test. A single user is represented by each Thread.
# So if you wish to simulate a load test with 5 concurrent users then you need to enter 5 as the value
# for this property.
number.of.threads=3

# It indicates the time taken to create all of the threads needed to fore the requests.
# If you set 10 seconds as the ramp-up period for 5 threads then the framework will take 10 seconds to create those 5 threads,
# i.e. each thread will be in use appx 2 secs gap between the requests.
# Also by setting its value to 0 all the threads can be created at once at the same time.
# Note- If you want to ramp up and fire more threads/user-requests in less time e.g. 5 threads in 2secs(or 1 sec),
# then, use '@UseHttpClient(SslTrustHttpClient.class)' as this closes the connection before making next connection.
ramp.up.period.in.seconds=3

# Keep it equal or lesser than "number.of.threads" size
#During the ramp up period, say 10 sec, how many requests you want to fire.
#e.g. in 10 secs, I want to fire 5 requests, that means, if you loop 6 times ie loop.count=6
#you fire 5*(60/10)=30 per min i.e. 30*60 = 1800 per hour i.e. 1800*8=14400 per 8hrs
requests.during.ramp.up.period=5

# By specifying its value framework gets to know that how many times the test(s) will be repeated
# e.g.
loop.count=2
